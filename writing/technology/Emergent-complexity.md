With the initial platform unified, we want to guide the emergent complexity that develops on this platform in order to ensure that it remains both fair to the users and useful to society as a while.

## Attribution & Work
One of the key features is that the building of this will define work and that we want to properly compensate the contributors for their efforts. With the goal of creating a better economic system, we must prioritize equitable compensation.

## Human to Computer Knowledge Transfer
One of the hard problems is to properly transfer human knowledge to computers.
Initially we want to transfer the low-hanging fruit. This would be general knowledge such is available in the Wikipedia database.
In order to reach parity with existing human systems, we have to coordinate an effort to transfer domain specific knowledge as well. This can be done by gaining access to sector based

## Continuous Processing Based on Temporal Coherence
With data transfer delays better accounted for and based on statistical math, we can move from digital computing back to temporal computing as it exists in the human brain.
