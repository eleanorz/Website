# Distributed knowledge repository

The entire sum of human knowledge and the processes that it governs are larger than any single computer or cluster of computer can handle. In fact it represents all the computers, humans, and machines that exist.

This technology is built on top of existing work on distributed systems, especially distributed hash tables. Just like people, each computer keeps a local repository of knowledge applicable to its daily function. For the most part there will be a lot of overlap in this core code base just like human education covers the same set of core educational principles.

The arch of knowledge that exists on top of these individual computers will start to span the core of knowledge of the process on earth. First centralized, than distributed as it grows in granularity. Clusters will follow real world examples of economic clustering such as finance in New York City, technology in Silicon Valley, or government in Washington D.C.
