# Technology

We have always been an species of invention. These new technologies have propelled us forward and freed us from the hardships that we had suffered. Ages past, we invented the story and language. We learned to harness fire and build weapons. From hunting and gathering we domesticated plants and animals. Weapons, art, music, science, mathematics, all the way to the things that we are building to day. 

The infrastructure that we want to build is based on neuroscience and the function of the brain. We can create a computational system that performs a number of basic functions.
Process management. This would be the correlation of Type 1 thinking from Thinking Fast and Slow. We call this intuition or instinct. Itâ€™s the wiring that regulated day to day activities.
Memory storage. This is big data.
Predictive simulation. This is where we think through decisions and try to statistically evaluate their outcomes.
Modeling update. This is what is Type 2 thought. Slow thought that rewires the brain slowly by analyzing and mediating the other mental processes.
