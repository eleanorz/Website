- Education is the process of mental calibration for children to integrate and participate in society. More mature societies require more complex interactions and thus more education.
- This works best when we know understand how the person being taught perceives the world and what they value
- Over a large population, there are statistical groups of mentalities that we can optimize for, which may not be viable in a single teacher environment
- The brunt of education can and should be moved off the shoulders of teachers so that they can focus on a mixture of improving the educational software and addressing specific needs of certain children
- We can be able to identify the strengths of children early on and then play to those strengths while taking into consideration projected labor needs
- The children in the middle can be nudged towards certain professions so that the proper supply to demand ration can be maintained when they are adults
- This will also give them more options and choices in their education. Activities that they are vested in will be attached with much more enthusiasm and accelerated the pace of learning
- This will converge with gaming. Motivation can come from game design theory and be constructed in a way where they stay positively engaged
