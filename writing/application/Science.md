- This is science as a system. It’s about merge resolution of knowledge and identifying contributing factors to match observations.
- There is work in the experimentation phase as well as the connection and integration phase.
- As we identify more of what we don’t know we can then tailor specific experiments to identify those

Modeling and simulation with proper simulation engines gives a low cost sandbox for adolescents to experiment, play, and learn. Notable contemporary examples include Minecraft, Kerbal Space Program, Eve Online, among others.
These provide a save but competitive environment where individuals can experiment without fear of repercussions. Exposure to environments that used to be high cost are now replicable at low costs and the amount of learning becomes more intuitive as well.

> The world has arisen in some way or another. How it originated is the great question, and Darwin’s theory, like all other attempts to explain the origin of life, is thus far merely conjectural. I believe he has not even made the best conjecture possible in the present state of our knowledge.
