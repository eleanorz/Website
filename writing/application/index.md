# Application

This goal of this system is to try to bridge the gaps between different sectors and domains. As such, it has applications in all these domains and can accelerate progress across the board. Here we explore the applications on a case by case basis.

## Human Experience

The human experience is something that we hold very close to our hearts. The majority of the human experience is shared, with the greatest differences stemming from culture and socioeconomic classes. Still, our commonalities far exceed our differences. There are a few key pieces of the human experience that we want to explore.

## Economic Sectors

The lifeblood of the planet is in our economic sectors. This isn’t just the sectors that cater to human needs but also those that cater to planetary needs as well. For the most part we have created fairly clear divides within these sectors, but they are very much interconnected as different parts of the same large integrated system. Generally we have corporations that focus on certain economic sectors and represent the interests of that sector. We have made amazing progress through this methodology. However, if we take an integrated approach, we see that there is much more progress that can be made in a much more holistic and ethical manner.

## Knowledge Domains

We have separated knowledge into domains based on similarities to facilitate ease of learning and provide mental structures for us to place and locate the knowledge that we have learned. Knowledge of course, stems from nature and reality, and different domains of knowledge are just different perspectives on the same reality. Let’s explore their interconnections as well as how we can fill the gaps and continue to grow these domains.
