# Relationships

- Relationships are governed by society
- They are subject to market demands and production by society. Expectations and values are societal as well.
- Beyond the individual relationship, social norms and community can either push or pull those relationships together or apart depending on values and leverage that different people have
- In order to make relationships better, we have to improve society as a while and identify the problem areas
- These issues are looked and diagnosed by psychologists, sociologists, and counselors and problems are identified but solutions are hard to put into place
- Empathy is key but there are also many forces that exist in the opposing direction. The forces in competing directions create the quality of relationships that we experience today.
- Other relationships usually come out of circumstance.
- Intellectual relationships can be coordinated around what skill and knowledge sets different people have. If they converge on common outlook or goals, than different skill sets and experiences will help both minds converge at an accelerated rate
- When we dictate few metrics of success we are creating a culture of insecurity which leads to infidelity, conflict, and violence
	- This create a rat-race on the metrics of beauty, wealth, intelligence. Those that have these attributes are disproportionately privileged and those that are lacking in some are disadvantaged to the point where they don’t fulfill anywhere near their potential.
	- Beauty is being advertised and pushed to ever younger girls
	- Alcohol, partying, and other activities marketed as ‘fun’ that don’t contribute to someone’s longterm success
