# Advertising

- The goal of advertising is to match innovation and services to places where they are best utilized.
- Advertising works when it takes the customer’s needs in mind and sells them something that benefits them.
- People grow jaded when false desire is created. As the company is longer term than the individual, it should conduct thorough research on what is needed
- This is why finer grained demographic data is results in better sales - because you can identify the people that need your product more
- Mass media is able to influence people, especially those that consume media extensively. Setting false expectations about attractiveness, sex, etc. actually does societal damage.

# Improvements

- Customers won’t reject advertising if it is of high quality to the point where they trust the source
- Advertising publishers should have the customer’s needs in mind and their best interests at heart as well as the advertisers
- Publishers can take a cut from the spread between the cost of manufacture and the utility to the customer
