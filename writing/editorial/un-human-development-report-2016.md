# United Nations Human Development Report 2016

## Synopsis

These technologies would address many of the key issues noted in this year’s publication of the UN Human Development Report which addressed the nature of work and the problems around it. For a global infrastructure project, we cannot disregard the fact that considerations are different than for a capitalistic project.
We have to take into consideration the totality of resources in the world including human capital. Especially for developing countries, but still applicable to developed countries, we have to monitor the development and application of skill and application of labor on all levels.
Technological access in developing countries have vastly expanded the access to both participation 
However, the incentives are skewed towards companies maintaining leverage at the cost of hindering global development in the long run.
Completed models and simulation technology would provide both the opportunity to be productive globally as well as access to the tools to develop local infrastructures.
The education pipeline could be optimized through a conjunction of rewards and giving individuals choices to pursue areas of contribution that make the most sense to them.

The infamous marshmallow test determined that delayed gratification was a key indicator to many metrics of success in life. In a follow up experiment, children were exposed to varying degrees of reliability of experiences. The first group was told things and then those promises were followed through on. The second group were told things but not reliability fulfilled. As a result, the first group with the reliable experiences were able to wait four times as long as the second group.
These and numerous other psychological experiences highlight the vast amount impact that the environment has on an individuals’ development and ability to contribute. This is an environment that we are able to actively impact, especially through the cost reduction and experience replication available to technology.

The Stanford prison experiment was also an indicator of social factors as well as expected behavior in situations.
This document also noted that there is an increase in non-compensated work that is becoming available such as through Wikipedia and open-source projects.
This follows the notion of non-profits where there is a discrepancy of what needs to be done with what is profitable. This is due to the fact that projects that have a small amount of impact over a large population are hard to properly attribute and account for.
If this work were properly accounted for, then we would no longer need non-profits and contributions can be properly rewarded to encourage further work in that area.
