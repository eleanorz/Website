Philosophy is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality, and existence, especially when considered as an academic discipline.

From the moment we are born into the world, our mind races. We grow up exploring and slowly pushing our limits little by little, venturing deeper into the great unknown. The world amazes us but also frustrates us. Things donâ€™t always go how we expect them to go or how we wish they would go. Still, there is hope as there are reasons behind why things happen.

Sometimes we have to go to extreme lengths to explain something that is seemingly simple. This is the journey of that discovery and seeking out what concepts like meaning and truth actually are.
