# Existence


- These are the fundamental questions: what does it mean to exist
- We ask why we exist because we learn of causality, if we can discover the root causality than we feel like we can figure out anything
- This is a hard question however because we have the wrong perception of the starting point. Itâ€™s not the beginning but instead it is now
- Both the future and the past step from this moment. When we are thinking about memories, we are actually reliving patterns that have been imprinted in our minds. This is why some memories are stronger than others and why memories can be influenced or forgotten over time
