# Knowledge

- It’s important to remember what the platform we are hosting knowledge is
	- Mind is a neural network
	- 30 watt of energy equivalence with accumulation of waste products from overwork
	- Sleep possibly helps clear out this waste product as well as taking care of some maintenance operations, thus staying awake extensively can build up toxicity
- Connection of inputs and outputs, modeling and simulation based on past occurrence
- This means knowledge is local in time and space and we consistently seed to expand it
- 

- The library analogy is faulty
- Knowledge is fundamentally about causality; causality of our environment and what actions our sensory inputs should result in
- At some point, the knowledge of society exceeded the scope of an individual’s mind.


Before we start, there exists a question of what is knowledge, what is reality and how do we know it is? Let’s start by stating that both the past and the present stem from this moment, now. Both the past and the future stem from this moment in time. Your memories are just latent pathways replaying in your brain.

We work by consolidating different stories and inputs that we get. We try to rationalize them in a manner that makes sense. When we are small this is easy, but when we get older this becomes harder as we reach the point where the information is very noisy.

This is why we are told to go to original sources. Every transmission of information results in a loss of fidelity, much like recompressing an images over and over again.
