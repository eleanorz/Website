> I truly believe that individuals can make a difference in society. Since periods of change such as the present one come so rarely in human history, it is up to each of us to make the best use of our time to help create a happier world.

# Destiny

- Our mind is a proxy for the needs of our body and the fundamental forces of our components
- The cells in our body have very well defined chemical and energy needs to function, as do the atoms and molecules that compose it
- Similarly, our society and economic system are very much constrained by the real needs and limitations of its components. When we do not understand those components we strain the system until it breaks or collapses
- Our destiny is to understand and align the needs of everyone and everything and their place within our planetary ecosystem. This is the purpose of intelligence.
- This means that everything that happens has a meaning.
